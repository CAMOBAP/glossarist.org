    <span class="value-precision">Precision is important</span>
    when authoring standards and&nbsp;other consequential documents.
    Since problem domains and&nbsp;terminologies are&nbsp;constantly evolving,
    accurate authoring and&nbsp;interpretation of&nbsp;documents is&nbsp;difficult without a&nbsp;shared&nbsp;vocabulary.

  <p>
    Maintaining a&nbsp;vocabulary involves many challenges, including
    tracking up-to-date definitions and preferred term expressions,
    managing relationships between concepts,
    and making the vocabulary database continuously accessible by&nbsp;authors&nbsp;and&nbsp;readers.

  <p>
    Dissatisfied by&nbsp;how&nbsp;general-purpose&nbsp;tools such&nbsp;as&nbsp;wikis and&nbsp;spreadsheets handle these challenges,
    and&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;vocabulary&nbsp;management workflows at&nbsp;ISO,
    we’ve built a&nbsp;special-purpose open&nbsp;solution that&nbsp;embodies&nbsp;those&nbsp;workflows.

  <h3>What is Glossarist and why use it?</h3>

  <p>
    Glossarist is a suite of open software
    for managing the vocabulary
    and for exposing that vocabulary via accessible human- and machine-friendly interfaces.

  <p>
    Underlying that software
    is a framework for thinking about vocabulary lifecycle and evolution
    that was inspired by ISO terminology management processes.

  <p>
    The Glossarist framework complies with the principles of terminology
    organization described in
    <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/38109.html">ISO 704:2009</a>,
    and facilitates terminology management in accordance with
    <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/40362.html">ISO 10241-1:2011</a>.

      <p>
      With Glossarist, <strong>vocabulary&nbsp;curators</strong>&nbsp;can:

      <ul>
        <li>Manage concept hierarchy and inter-concept relationships.</li>
        <li>Keep track of each concept’s preferred terms in multiple languages.</li>
        <li>Register lifecycle events that affect obsolete/preferred statuses for terms and concept definitions.</li>
        <li>Enable vocabulary users to efficiently explore the vocabulary.</li>
        <li>Enable vocabulary contributors to propose changes to term expressions or definitions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="use-group">
      <p>
      Subsequently, <strong>document authors and&nbsp;readers</strong>&nbsp;can:

      <ul>
        <li>Quickly locate the most accurate and up-to-date term to express a concept in a given language.</li>
        <li>Quickly locate current definitions for unfamiliar terms and disambiguate meaning.</li>
        <li>Explore adjacent concepts relevant to the topic at hand.</li>
        <li>Track down definitions of outdated terms when reading documents authored in the past.</li>
      </ul>
