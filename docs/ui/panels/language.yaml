  [NOTE]
  ====
  To bring application more in line with how registry data is manageed,
  in the next version of the app
  language-specific registry item data will be split into subregistries,
  and the Languages panel will no longer work the way described on this page.
  ====


  ==== Listed languages

  Languages supported by the registry are listed.
  If currently selected registry item had not been translated to certain language,
  that language will appear with a red “translate” icon.


  ==== Selected language

  The selected language determines the language of registry information displayed,
  and in most ways is essentially like selecting a language subregistry.

  Selected language affects:

  . Primary concept designations (displayed in main view of List module, the Source panel, and and Relationships panel)
  . The contents of the Basics panel in List module
  . The contents of the main view of the Card module

  Revision choice is per-language.
  This means that selected language affects what’s shown in Revisions and Selected Revision panels,
  and revision selected in Edit/Translate modules.

  **Special:** Review module.
  In Review, the main view always shows proposed change in the language originally recorded in the change request.

  In this module, the Languages panel affects *the comparison target*:
  If a different language is selected using the Languages panel,
  then the main view shows a diff between the original language and the selected language.
