  == Download

  Download the latest release link:/desktop[here].
  Currently, installers for Windows and macOS are available, with Linux coming soon.

  Run the installer and proceed according to instructions shown.

  == Set up a GitHub account

  This guide is written with the assumption that your organization relies on GitHub
  for hosting concept system data repository.

  If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, head to https://github.com/[github.com] and sign up
  (it’s free). Take note of your username and password.

  NOTE: If you want to enable second-factor authentication, you would need to
  generate a Personal Access Token and provide it to the app instead of your password later.

  == First launch

  On first launch, Glossarist will ask you to specify some necessary settings.

  - *Repository URL:* this should be provided your Glossarist support team, ask them!
  - *Git username:* this is the username you chose when signing up for GitHub.
  - *Git author name:* specify your name. This is important, as it will show on edits you make.
  - *Git author email:* specify your relevant work email.
    This is even more important, as it identifies your edits and change requests as yours.
