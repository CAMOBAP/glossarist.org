  Registry item ID. Read-only; set when item proposal is accepted
  and cannot be altered thereafter.

<p>
Heads up: Currently, it is required to specify item ID when approving a proposal
for a new registry item. In future this registry management software
will use fully automatic item IDs. It will allow associating
an external item ID if needed, however.
