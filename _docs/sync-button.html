Edits that you make via Glossarist get saved on your computer.
To persist your changes in the main repository and see new changes by others,
<strong>it is required to synchronize</strong>.

<h3>What happens during synchronization</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Registry’s data repository is checked for new changes made by collaborators,
including submitting organizations and other registry managers.

<li>
Those changes (if any) are fetched and combined with your local changes (if any).

<li>
The newly created registry version is then uploaded to data repository.
</ul>


<h3>Merge conflicts</h3>

<p>
If another collaborator has modified the same data as you, and they synchronized first,
it is possible that your changes cannot be automatically incorporated (merged).

<p>
You will know this happened if after sync you see a message on top of the window
saying that remote changes cannot be incorporated and merge conflict has occurred.

<p>
Such a scenario currently requires manual intervention.
Please get in touch with your Glossarist integrator to resolve this situation.

<p>
<em>To reduce the probability of merge conflicts</em>, make sure to run synchronization often.
Do not “hoard changes”—it is often easier to revert undesired changes than resolve a merge conflict.
Generally, the only reason you’d want to postpone synchronization is if you are offline.
