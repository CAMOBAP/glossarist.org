title: The “Languages” panel
excerpt: >-
  Choose language to view or edit items in.
  Controls the contents of “Selected revision” panel.
  (In “Review”, only affects comparison target.)

<p>
The “Languages” panel lists available languages.

<p>
The selected language determines the language of registry information displayed,
and in most ways is essentially like selecting a language subregistry.

<p>
Selected language affects:

<ul>
<li>Primary concept designations (displayed in main view of List module, the Source panel, and and Relationships panel)
<li>The contents of the Basics panel in List module
<li>The contents of the main view of the Card module
</ul>

<p>
Revision choice is per-language.
This means that selected language affects what’s shown in Revisions and Selected Revision panels,
and revision selected in Edit/Translate modules.

<p>
<strong>Special:</strong> Review module.
In Review, the main view always shows proposed change in the language originally recorded in the change request.

In this module, the Languages panel affects <em>the comparison target</em>:
If a different language is selected using the Languages panel,
then the main view shows a diff between the original language and the selected language.

<p>
Heads-up: To bring application more in line with how registry data is manageed,
in the next version of the app
language-specific registry item data will be split into subregistries,
and the Languages panel will no longer work the way described on this page.
