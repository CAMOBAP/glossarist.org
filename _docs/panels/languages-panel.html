<p>
The “Languages” panel lists available languages.

<p>
Heads-up: To bring application more in line with how registry data is manageed,
in the next version of the app
language-specific registry item data will be split into subregistries,
and the Languages panel will no longer work the way described on this page.


<h3>Listed languages</h3>

<p>
Languages supported by the registry are listed.
If currently selected registry item had not been translated to certain language,
that language will appear with a red “translate” icon.


<h3>Selected language</h3>

<p>
The selected language determines the language of registry information displayed,
and in most ways is essentially like selecting a language subregistry.

<p>
Selected language affects:

<ul>
<li>Primary concept designations (displayed in main view of List module, the Source panel, and and Relationships panel)
<li>The contents of the Basics panel in List module
<li>The contents of the main view of the Card module
</ul>

<p>
Revision choice is per-language.
This means that selected language affects what’s shown in Revisions and Selected Revision panels,
and revision selected in Edit/Translate modules.

<p>
<strong>Special:</strong> Review module.
In Review, the main view always shows proposed change in the language originally recorded in the change request.

In this module, the Languages panel affects <em>the comparison target</em>:
If a different language is selected using the Languages panel,
then the main view shows a diff between the original language and the selected language.
